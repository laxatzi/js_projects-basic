// WHAT ARE CALLBACKS?

// Callbacks (call me back later) is just the name of a convention for using js functions 
//There is not a special thing in javascript language syntactically, it is just a convention

// The work asynchronous - async means "take some time" "something will take place not now but in the future"
// asynchronous functions use callbacks to take some time to produce their results

// usually this happens when we are doing I/O e.g talking to databases, downloading things, reading files etc

// example of a normal function
