 // Minimum
        // Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.
        // use an alternative to Math.min method
 
 // Recursion
        // We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

        // -- zero is even
        // -- one is odd
        // -- for any other number N, its evenness is the same as N-2

        // Define a recursive function isEven that takes advantage of the above conclusions
        // The function should accept a single parameter (a positive integer) and return a Boolean

         //Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why is that? Can you think of a way to fix this?
   
         // console.log(isEven(50)); //
         // console.log(isEven(75)); //
         // console.log(isEven(-1)); //
