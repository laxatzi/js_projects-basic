/*
JavaScript Array map() Method
The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order. Note: map() does not execute the function for array elements without values
*/

/*
    .reduce()
Just like .map(), .reduce() also runs a callback for each element of an array. Whatâ€™s different here is that reduce passes the result of this callback (the accumulator) from one array element to the other.
The accumulator can be pretty much anything (integer, string, object, etc.) and must be instantiated or passed when calling .reduce()
SYNTAX: array.reduce(function(total, currentValue), initialValue)
