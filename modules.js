// what are modules?
/*
 Good authors divide their books into chapters and sections; good programmers divide their code into
 modules.
 Like book chapters are clusters of words...modules are just clusters of code.
Good modules are highly self-contained with distinct functionality.
They can be shuffled, removed or added when appropriate without disturbing the program as a whole
