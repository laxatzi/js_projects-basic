//Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
// We use the javascript formula for this : 
//Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min


/* Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.
