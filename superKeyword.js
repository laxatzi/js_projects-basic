/*
  Explanation:

- We can pass the argument from child 
  constructor to parent constructor 
  through super() method like above code 
  snippet.

- We can override the parent class properties 
  inside constructor of child class.

/*
  Explanation:

- Child class can access the methods of 
  parent class using 'super' object like 
  super.organise().

- Similarly static methods of child class can 
  access the static method of parent class 
  with help of 'super' object.
